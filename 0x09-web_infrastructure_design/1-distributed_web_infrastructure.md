Definitions and Explanations:

1. Adding New Servers: Each additional server is introduced to enhance the system's reliability and prevent a collapse in case of server failure. Think of it as having multiple firefighters ready to handle emergencies. If one firefighter is busy, another can step in to keep the fire station running smoothly. 
2. Load Balancer Algorithm (Round Robin): The load balancer employs the Round Robin algorithm. This is similar to kids taking turns on a swing. Each child gets a set time to swing before giving another child a chance. Similarly, computer processes take turns using the CPU. This way, no single server is overwhelmed, and the workload is distributed evenly, just like swings are shared at the playground. 
3. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Load Balancing: Your load balancer uses an Active-Active setup. This means both nodes (servers) are actively serving the same type of service simultaneously. In an Active-Passive setup, while one node is active, the other remains on standby, ready to step in if the active node encounters any issues. It's like having two athletes on a relay team—one runs while the other is prepared to take over if needed. 
4. Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster: In this cluster, there's a primary/master node that handles write operations (like updating the database). Replicas/slave nodes copy data from the primary and manage read operations. This setup enhances performance and provides redundancy. If the primary fails, a replica can step in as the new primary to maintain data availability and reliability. Think of it as having a main chef and sous chefs in a restaurant kitchen. 
5. Primary vs. Replica Node in Application: The primary node is like the main chef in the kitchen—it handles all the important decisions and changes. On the other hand, replica nodes are like sous chefs—they make sure everything is running smoothly and assist with preparing dishes (serving read requests). This way, even if the main chef is unavailable, the sous chefs can still provide delicious food (data) to customers (users)

Issues:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF): You're absolutely right! Relying on just one load balancer is like having a single ticket booth at a concert. If that one booth has an issue, the entire ticketing process could come crashing down. Introducing a backup load balancer would be akin to having a backup booth, ensuring that if one has a glitch, the other can step in seamlessly. 
2. Security Concerns (No Firewall, No HTTPS):
   - Unsecure HTTP Communication: Communicating over plain HTTP is like sending sensitive information on a postcard—it's visible to anyone who cares to look. Implementing HTTPS is like sending that information in an encrypted envelope, making it much more secure against eavesdropping. 
   - No Firewall: Having no firewall is like leaving the doors of a house wide open. It makes the system susceptible to various attacks, like a denial-of-service (DOS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack that could flood the system with requests, overwhelming it. Also, without a firewall, attackers might find hidden entry points to exploit.    
3. Importance of Monitoring:
   - You're absolutely right! Monitoring is like having a security guard keeping an eye on your property. It helps you catch issues before they escalate into big problems. Whether it's downtime, security threats, or performance bottlenecks, monitoring allows you to nip them in the bud. This not only keeps your system healthy but also improves user experience.
